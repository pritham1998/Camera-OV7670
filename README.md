# Camera-OV7670
Description

The camera module is powered from a single +3.3V power supply. An external oscillator provide the clock source for camera module XCLK pin. With proper configuration to the camera internal registers via I2C bus, then the camera supply pixel clock (PCLK) and camera data back to the host with synchronize signal like HREF and VSYNC. The OV7670 camera module is a low cost 0.3 mega pixel CMOS color camera module, it can output 640x480 VGA resolution image at 30fps. The OV7670 camera module build in onboard LDO regulator only single 3.3V power needed and can be used in Arduino, STM32,Chipkit, ARM, DSP , FPGA and etc.
